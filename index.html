                    <center><div class="caption">Beyond the actors and stage of UCLA Theater Film and Television's "Eurydice," stage manager and second-year theater student Kristin Hwang coordinates her 20-person crew for a cohesive, smooth production from start to finish.</center>

                    <center><div class="author">By William Thorne</div></center>

                    <div class="hline"></div>
                    
                    <p>Kristin Hwang is a stage manager and a mother of 20.</p>

                    <p>She comes across as a stern mother, commanding her cast and stage crew children from a gallery high up in the theater. She puts them in their places with a turn, a look and a smile. Hwang said once she has already established her authority and the rules in the room, a smile suffices to enforce them.</p>

                    <p>"The role of the stage manager is to help everyone in the production fulfill their full potential," said Hwang, a second-year theater student. "It's my job to make sure they're at their best."</p>

                    <p>Hwang acts as the hub of communication for a production. Through her microphone, she hears a dozen voices in her head, prompting her with questions about opening elevator doors and rain sound effects. She has to coordinate all of the voices toward a cohesive, smooth theater production.</p>

                    <p>Part of a stage manager's job is to take control of the situation when something goes wrong - the show must go on. Hwang would know; she has been in the job since her junior year of high school when she assumed the role for the musical "Annie."</p>

                    <p>As stage manager for "Eurydice," opening at the Little Theater tonight, Hwang has seen her fair share of awkward pauses and on-stage catastrophes.</p>

                    <p>"I would be most satisfied if everyone survives this production without any broken bones or bleeding," Hwang said.</p>

                    <p>Keeping the cast and crew out of hospital is a pessimistic target, but one which Hwang said is by no means easy to achieve. The set for "Eurydice"  has a small river basin flowing through it and an antique elevator which opens to reveal a running shower. Slipping and falling on set is a realistic prospect, Hwang said: Two actors have already fallen, trying to jump over the river.</p>

                    <p>On the darkened set of "Eurydice", bathed in eerie blue light, Hwang sat halfway up the banked benches, poring over a script, her face illuminated by the amber glow of reading lamps.</p>

                    <p>"Standby, lights, sound and go," Hwang enunciated into her microphone.</p>

                    <p>The lights flashed, coupled with a strange gurgling sound and a hefty book sailed down from the ceiling backstage left. The book smacked against the floor.</p>

                    <p>"That was way too fast," Hwang said. "Let's do that again."</p>

                    <p>A stage crew member hoists the book back to the ceiling, while Hwang carefully places a pink sticky note into her thick script. On the second attempt she counts slowly down from ten, clicking her fingers on each beat, marking the timing for the book to be lowered.</p>

                    <p>Hwang sees herself as the uniting factor between the stage crew, the cast and director. Being a stage manager is often a hectic, stressful experience, Hwang said, laughing in hysterical embarrassment when asked to recount her worst moment in a theater. Everything depends on her to coordinate the production and act as a compassionate leader to turn to with questions or issues.</p>

                    <p>Despite the order she maintains over proceedings, Hwang knows a perfect production is not a realistic goal.</p>

                    <p>"Something goes wrong every show, but that's the beauty of theater - no show is ever the same," Hwang said.</p>

                    <p>She recalls, on the Saturday night of "Annie," the actor playing Mr. Warbucks forgot his lines, jumping two pages, a quick change for Annie, a cue for the orchestra and several light cues.</p>

                    <p>In that moment the entire cast and crew froze, hearts in mouths.</p>

                    <p>"It was probably one of the worst moments of my life, but that's the time when stage managers have to shine and take control of the situation," Hwang said.</p>

                    <p>But Hwang has to put any setbacks and pre-show nerves behind her before the high of the curtain call. Even though she dabbled in acting in her first year at UCLA, Hwang said ever since she worked as stage manager for "Annie," she has been hooked on the stage crew experience, which she described as like being on crack.</p>

                    <p>"At a certain point in your life, you learn there are certain things you can't do and there certain things you're great at," Hwang said. "I learned that I'm good backstage and that I didn't need to be in the spotlight to fulfill my potential."</p>

                  <center><div class="author">By Natalie Green</div></center>
                  <div class="hline"></div>
                  <p>The tech crew lacked the time, money and supplies to construct the barricade for the "Les Mis&eacute;rables" set design, so the crew members formed one made up of people.</p>
                  <p>While this year's upcoming "24-Hour Musical" production still lies under wraps, third-year political science student Ariana Garcia reminisces on last year's performance of "Les Mis&eacute;rables."</p>
                  <p>"('24-Hour Musical') forces the crew to think creatively to get the things we need without spending money," Garcia said.</p>
                  <p>Garcia, along with the three other producers, wait for Saturday to reveal the culmination of months of coordinating play rights, auditing cast members and finalizing logistics: the "24-Hour Musical 2016."</p>
                  <p>"24-Hour Musical," co-produced by HOOLIGAN Theatre Company and Act III Theatre Ensemble, gives cast and crew 24 hours of closed rehearsals followed by one performance supported by a tech crew of 25 students. The show raises money for a local nonprofit, No Limits, which volunteers their Culver City location for day-of rehearsals.</p>
                  <p>Garcia and Julia Nelson, a second-year theater student with a costume design focus, make up half of the team of producers. Garcia, HOOLIGAN's artistic director, and Nelson, Act III's executive producer, will head the design team.</p>
                  <p>For "24-Hour Musical," Garcia and Nelson said tech becomes something entirely different from a traditional production - figuring out what is possible for a full production in 24 hours with a nonexistent budget.</p>
                  <p>After a night of planning on Saturday once the musical is revealed, Garcia said the crew will drive to HOOLIGAN's storage space to pull any usable costumes, props and scenic backgrounds. She hopes to divide the tech crew into teams, such as costume, prop and set.</p>
                  <p>"In the end, everyone just does what needs to be done," Garcia said.</p>
                  <p>While both Garcia and Nelson said they are dreading the sleep deprivation, Nelson said there's a certain thrill in everything coming together, with things going wrong and running around to fix everything.</p>
                  <p>"Being backstage, you get to absorb all of the energy," Nelson said. "Good and bad, hectic and crazy and wonderful."</p>
                  <p>Both Garcia and Nelson discovered their passion for theater in high school, beginning with onstage ambitions. While Nelson said she couldn't muster the courage to audition for her high school's production freshman year, Garcia spent all of high school acting.</p>
                  <p>Before UCLA, Garcia said she filled backstage roles only when necessary for her high school curriculum.</p>
                  <p>"I didn't realize how amazing tech was until I came to HOOLIGAN," Garcia said.</p>
                  <p>Garcia said she auditioned for HOOLIGAN's fall show, "Curtains," her first year. She didn't receive a role, but still wanted to be involved and joined the production management department.</p>
                  <p>Although Garcia said there's a satisfaction to performing, she prefers the behind-the-scenes aspect of equal involvement without the stress of memorizing lines or onstage mistakes. She said she has learned real-life skills, like working a drill and handcrafting a platform.</p>
                  <p>"Visually, without tech, the show is not a show," Garcia said.</p>
                  <p>Meanwhile, Nelson said she painted set designs in high school, which later transitioned to special effects makeup and finally her current passion: costume design.</p>
                  <p>"(In design), you get to be a part of the storytelling in a slightly more objective way," Nelson said.</p>
                  <p>Nelson said she wanted to pursue her passion in college, applying to all of her schools as a theater student. She selected the UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television for its ability to fluidly incorporate her interests in all specializations, rather than isolating subsections of acting, design and direction.</p>
                  <p>"Getting to be a part of the process and the theater-making in a visual way is just the method that I resonated with the most," Nelson said.</p>

                  <center><div class="caption">Assistant sound designer Katie Jost helped transform Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream" to take place during the 1930s.</center>
                  <center><div class="author">By Samantha Suman</div></center>
                  <div class="hline"></div>
                  <p>Katie Jost sits in the middle of the Little Theater in Macgowan Hall during a tech rehearsal, modifying sound effects, cutting music pieces and updating the cue sheet. The actors deliver the lines; her creations deliver the ambiance.</p>
                  <p>The third-year theater student is the assistant sound designer for UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television production of Shakespeare's "A Midsummer Night's Dream," premiering Friday. The five-act show has been adapted to take place in the 1930s Dust Bowl. Although Jost's absence from the stage does not put her in the spotlight, her contributions are crucial to the play's atmosphere.</p>
                  <p>Raised in Boston by two music teachers, Jost grew up surrounded by music. She was a member of her high school and middle school band, and also acted in musical theater.</p>
                  <p>"I liked performing, that's where I thought I was good at everything," Jost said.</p>
                  <p>However, upon moving to California to begin her studies at UCLA, she decided to pursue directing. When she became a support technician and sound designer for Act III Theatre Ensemble's production of "Complete History of America (Abridged)" in her first year, she decided to change her major to sound design.</p>
                  <p>"Being backstage is a lot easier once you are good at tech. It's a good time," Jost said.</p>
                  <p>She became involved with the crew of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" after asking the head sound designer and UCLA lecturer Jonathan Snipes if she could be part of the show, as she enjoyed working with him the previous quarter and wanted to do so again.</p>
                  <p>Jost met frequently with the director and other designers involved in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" to discuss the main concepts of the play before the production process.</p>
                  <p>Jost and Snipes pulled migrant-style music from the archives of the Library of Congress to create the desired "Okie"feeling, which she described as coming from the 1930s Midwest. They used songs recorded by migrant workers in working camps like "Sunny California" and "This Land is Your Land."</p>
                  <p>"Eventually it comes together," Jost said. "It's much talking and previewing and sampling bits until you get it right."</p>
                  <p>The musical interludes and the atmospheric elements of "A Midsummer Night's Dream" are Jost's favorite parts of the show. She said from old car sounds to forest winds, the repetitive sound bites act as cues to create the mood, tying together one part of the show with another.</p>
                  <p>"The sound really puts them inside of the sound world and you feel like you are hearing it in this mystical, '30s Dust Bowl forest," Jost said.</p>
                  <p>Jeffrey Pielago, a fourth-year theater student, is the sound board operator for "A Midsummer Night's Dream." His job is to put Jost's and Snipes' sounds into effect.</p>
                  <p>He was assigned the position to fulfill a class requirement, but said he has learned a lot about working backstage. The more time he has spent behind the scenes, the more appreciative he has become of the crew, he said.</p>
                  <p>As an actor, Pielago said he always tried to be appreciative of the work done by the crew. However, he never fully comprehended the technical elements of the show.</p>
                  <p>"That's true sacrifice and true love for what you do and your art," Pielago said.</p>
                  <p>Jost said the length of the play and tech rehearsals proved to be the hardest part of working on "A Midsummer Night's Dream." It was difficult to complete all of her designs given the short time frame that began during week one of winter quarter.</p>
                  <p>Regardless of backstage stress, Jost said she is drawn to sound design because of its unique ability to create a non-visual world. Her work is not always noticed right away, but it is present throughout the show. Working with music is rewarding for Jost, even though becoming a sound designer was not her original plan.</p>
                  <p>"It feels right when you know where you are and where you are supposed to be," Jost said.</p>

                  <center><div class="caption">Third-year theater student Chris Yu is the lighting designer for the Shakespeare Company at UCLA's production of "Twelfth Night." Yu determines the color of the light, the equipment for the show and how much power to use.</center>
                  <center><div class="author">By Maryrose Kulick</div></center>
                  <div class="hline"></div>
                    <p>While some shine in the spotlight, Chris Yu prefers to shine the spotlight on others behind the buttons and controls of a lighting board.</p>

                    <p>"I enjoy being part of the process of creating the show but not actually being on stage," said Yu.</p>

                    <p>As a first-time lighting designer, third-year theater student Yu will debut his skills on Friday for the Shakespeare Company at UCLA's production of "Twelfth Night" in the Bruin Reception Room.</p>

                    <p>Prior to his new position, Yu worked as a lighting assistant on "The Automobile Graveyard" in 2015. Now, without any assistants of his own on "Twelfth Night," the task of designing and implementing all of the lighting effects in the production rests on his shoulders.</p>

                    <p>As a lighting designer, Yu is responsible for determining the equipment needed for the show, how much power they will need for each light, the positioning of the light units in the space and what color the stage should be bathed in for certain scenes.</p>

                    <p>One of the main challenges Yu has faced, however, is unsubstantial rehearsal time.</p>

                    <p>The company was unable to secure a venue to hold a tech rehearsal without changing performance dates. To combat this, Yu said they will be hauling their equipment to the Bruin Reception Room early on Friday. They will only have about three hours to run through the lighting cues.</p>

                    <p>If the director wants to make any changes, Yu said he will have to update his design on the spot, since the changes may not have been rehearsed prior to showtime.</p>

                    <p>"I knew going into it the process was going to be trying for the tech team," said Will Block, third-year theater student and director of "Twelfth Night." "And I knew that (Yu) was a very patient guy, and a very flexible and creative guy."</p>

                    <p>Originally, Block thought they would only have 20 minutes to rehearse lighting and sound before the first show, and needed someone who could handle this pressure. Block said while other people may have shied away from the task, he was impressed with Yu's confident attitude throughout the process.</p>

                    <p>"I've thrown some legitimately ridiculous requests at him and I've never seen him balk or roll his eyes once. He's an excellent team player," Block said.</p>

                    <p>Block said he worked closely with Yu on a weekly basis to develop the lighting design, maintaining strong communication to supplement the lack of rehearsal time.</p>

                    <p>To start the process of lighting design, Yu said he first has to read the play, and know the time and location of each scene.</p>

                    <p>"If it's during the day, I would use a brighter warmer color, as opposed to doing a night light, I use a much cooler color," Yu said.</p>

                    <p>Yu said the color of the stage can greatly impact the way one interprets the story.</p>

                    <p>"I help create the mood," Yu said.</p>

                    <p>For his overall design, Yu said he has taken elements from a traditional Shakespearean production into account. Originally, the plays would have been performed under natural lighting, so Yu has to adjust the artificial lighting to create the same effect.</p>

                    <p>Even though Yu works closely with the director to produce his desired vision, he said he does have his own creative liberty.</p>

                    <p>Yu said he is most looking forward to staging a shipwreck in the first scene. He plans to wash the stage in dark blue color and incorporate quick lights that switch on and off to enact the image of a storm.</p>

                    <p>"That's the one scene that I could potentially put a lot of my artistic design elements into," Yu said. "Rather than the rest of the show where it's more of a general wash of lights to let the audience see the actors' faces."</p>

                    <p>Block said the scene functions like a dream-like dance, where midway through, Duke Orsino interrupts saying, "Enough; no more: 'Tis not so sweet now as it was before."</p>

                    <p>"We need to snap out of that sort of dreamworld and go right back into reality," Block said. "The lights are going to become very, very, very crucial in that moment."</p>

                    <p>Yu said he enjoys the process of developing a vision and seeing it recreated in the performance space, and feels accomplished after completing any performance.</p>

                    <p>"At its best, lighting is almost universally responsible for tone," Block said. "It is the director's and the designer's best tool for creating atmosphere."</p>

                  <center><div class="caption">Graduate student Tatiana Kuilanoff designed the set of "The Trojan Women" by collaborating with the play's two directors.</center>
                  <center><div class="author">By Sasha Cheechov</div></center>
                  <div class="hline"></div>
                    <p>It would be impossible to distinguish set designer Tatiana Kuilanoff from the rest of the stage crew if not for her sharp coat and clean pants. She is in charge of the black-shirted crew members bustling across the stage and has designed 14 sets in the past, but she runs about touching up the painted floor and positioning props like any other crew member.</p>

                    <p>The production of "The Trojan Women," put on by graduate students at the UCLA Department of Arts and originally by the Greek playwright Euripides, tells the story of the fates of the women of Troy after the city is famously ravaged. It is split into two acts, directed by two students, and performed by entirely separate casts. Kuilanoff, a graduate student in set design, is responsible for creating the set, the one piece that brings them all together.</p>

                    <p>Kuilanoff said she worked for months to brainstorm, design and bring together the stage. The atypical 360-degree placement of seating and sets has both literal and figurative significance: It is meant to capture the in-your-face nature of the play and bring audience members up close and personal with actors.</p>

                    <p>The purpose of dividing the play was to incorporate the two directors' creative perspectives, said Michelle Gong, a graduate student in theater directing and director of the first act. However, the division caused creative difficulties for Kuilanoff.</p>

                    <p>Gong's ideas for the set and production centered around a ritualistic temple feeling, while the visions of Angela Lopez, a graduate student in theater directing and director of the second act, focused more on movement and fragility as the women meet tragedy in the play's climax and conclusion, Kuilanoff said.</p>

                    <p>To bring to life the reality and tragedy of war, Kuilanoff and the two directors worked to create a set in which the audience is forced to face uncomfortable, intense and emotional moments.</p>

                    <p>The audience of less than 50 is seated in a single ring of chairs that borders a circular stage. The stage is not raised, and no one sits in front or behind each other. Actors come face-to-face with the audience during the performance, and the set makes the viewers feel trapped and on edge, Kuilanoff said.</p>

                    <p>The circularity of the theater ensures that all attention is pointed toward center stage and allows the audience to witness the reactions of their peers to the play's tragedies.</p>

                    <p>"In our society, there's a sense of detachment (from war). People look away; they don't want to recognize war is happening. This piece forces us to watch the chaos and atrocities that are happening still to this day," Kuilanoff said.</p>

                    <p>The space Kuilanoff began working with was a small, confined theater that is a classroom by day. She felt pressure to formulate a set that had the atmosphere both directors desired, but was also temporary enough to be quickly taken apart.</p>

                    <p>Two months before the production, Kuilanoff came across an image of an art installation piece online that she couldn't ignore. The cliff-like structure with red threads extending from it and how it would contrast toughness and fragility, became the main visual inspiration for the set</p>

                    <p>"It was very poetic, and for me it instantly felt like 'Trojan Women.' Because 'Trojan Women' has this roughness, this rawness, this ritualistic aspect, but there's also this fragile nature to it," Kuilanoff said.</p>

                    <p>The piece led Kuilanoff to create a circular cage of red, distressed ropes hanging from the ceiling around the stage and seating.</p>

                    <p>Gong said for the first act, the cage is a symbolic barrier between the audience and the outside, between heaven and earth. In Lopez's second act however, it stands for a distortion of time, signifying that for the women, time is running out.</p>

                    <p>Kuilanoff also incorporated a red-splatter painting technique by vigorously flicking the paint along the stage's edge. The angry color of blood alludes to the ferocity of war and the pain the Trojan women feel, she said.</p>

                    <p>The three months of unseen work that went into Kuilanoff's intricate set allows the production to make a bold statement against the way society sweeps war under the rug, Gong said.</p>

                    <p>"There are so many takes on this set, but conceptually it all fits with the idea of fate and entrapment, and witnessing the chaos and atrocities at hand," Kuilanoff said. "Don't avert your gaze - this is it."</p>
